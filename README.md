# Project Rome

"Project Rome" is a project code name for Microsoft's cross-device experiences platform using the Microsoft Graph. This toolkit, consisting of API sets on multiple development platforms, allows an app on a client device to interact with apps and services on a host device that is signed in with or receptive to the same Microsoft Account (MSA) or Azure Active Directory (AAD) account. This allows developers to program cross-device and cross-platform experiences that are centered around user tasks rather than devices.

Visit the [Project Rome landing page](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/project-rome) for more general information about Project Rome.

See the [Project Rome docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/project-rome/) for how-to guides and API reference docs that will help you get started integrating Project Rome features into your app.

## What's New

### Microsoft Graph Notifications
Notifications are the most effective way to re-engage your users. They can catch your users' attention and bring the user back to your app. In a multi-device world, your users can access your apps and services from anywhere, across different platforms and devices where your apps have a presence. 

Microsoft Graph Notifications and Project Rome SDKs enables your app to send notifications targeted at a user, across their multiple devices and platforms. It also enables syncing notification states across user's different endpoints, and more. Check out this new Notifications feature from the [Microsoft Graph documentation page here](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/concepts/notifications-concept-overview) and the [Project Rome SDK documentation page here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/project-rome/).
