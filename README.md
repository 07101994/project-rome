# Project Rome

"Project Rome" is a project code name for Microsoft's Remote Systems platform. This feature, consisting of API sets on multiple development platforms, allows an app on a client (local) device to interact with apps and services on a host (remote) device that is signed in with or receptive to the Microsoft Account (MSA) on the client device. This allows developers to program cross-device experiences that are centered around user tasks rather than devices.

Currently, Project Rome is implemented for the following scenarios:
* Windows client to Windows host
* Android client to Windows host

The first scenario, dealing only with the Universal Windows platform, is documented in [how-to content](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/launch-resume/connected-apps-and-devices) and [API reference documentation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/windows.system.remotesystems.aspx) on the Windows Dev Center, as well as in the [Windows SDK samples](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/tree/master/Samples/RemoteSystems). See these resources for more detailed information about the Project Rome feature in general. Any scenarios involving non-Windows platforms are documented in this repository. You will also find end-to-end sample app(s) for Windows here.
