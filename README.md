# Project Rome

"Project Rome" is a project code name for Microsoft's Remote Systems platform. This feature, consisting of API sets on multiple development platforms, allows an app on a client (local) device to interact with apps and services on a host (remote) device that is signed in with or receptive to the Microsoft Account (MSA) on the client device. This allows developers to program cross-device experiences that are centered around user tasks rather than devices.

Currently, Project Rome is implemented for the following scenarios:
* Windows client to Windows host
* Android client to Windows host
