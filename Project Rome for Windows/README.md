# Project Rome for Windows

The simplest Rome scenario, in which both the client and host devices are on the Universal Windows Platform, is documented in [how-to content](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/launch-resume/connected-apps-and-devices) and [API reference documentation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/windows.system.remotesystems.aspx) on the Windows Dev Center. 

See the related [Remote Systems sample](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/tree/master/Samples/RemoteSystems) for an example of the basic usage of these APIs. Or, see the [samples](samples/) folder for full-featured sample apps that showcase this feature.
